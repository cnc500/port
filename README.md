Portfolio

The purpose of this assignment is to my personal portfolio to showcase my work and to provide my my potential employers information about me.

Accomplishments

You can click on my work to date and a link takes you to the repositories where my work resides.  Note that there are only two assignments so far, and Projects 3,4 and 5 serve as placeholders for future projects, 

Flexbox was used extensively, and the Refactoring project link is tied to the large image above the four smaller ones.  There is, however some work tobe done such as having all the project links tied to their respective images.  Nevertheless, using Flexbox will help with the accessibility of this page on multiple devices.

Alternatives have been provided in case images fail to load.

All the above has been accomplished while still maintaining same output/webpage.

Deployment

The deployment of the webpage was successful and is at https://cnc500.github.io/Port/
